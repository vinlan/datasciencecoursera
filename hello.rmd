This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(xlsx)
CQP3<- read.xlsx("C:/Users/Vineela.Lanka/Desktop/Q.xlsx", 9)
CQP3
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(CQP3$QSpeed)
```


## hello
